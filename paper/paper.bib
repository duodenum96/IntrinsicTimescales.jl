	abstract = {Timescales characterize the pace of change for many dynamic processes in nature. They are usually estimated by fitting the exponential decay of data autocorrelation in the time or frequency domain. Here we show that this standard procedure often fails to recover the correct timescales due to a statistical bias arising from the finite sample size. We develop an alternative approach to estimate timescales by fitting the sample autocorrelation or power spectrum with a generative model based on a mixture of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes using adaptive approximate Bayesian computations. Our method accounts for finite sample size and noise in data and returns a posterior distribution of timescales that quantifies the estimation uncertainty and can be used for model selection. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method on synthetic data and illustrate its application to recordings from the primate cortex. We provide a customizable Python package that implements our framework via different generative models suitable for diverse applications.},

	abstract = {Many studies have identified the role of localized and distributed cognitive functionality by mapping either local task-related activity or distributed functional connectivity ({FC}). However, few studies have directly explored the relationship between a brain region’s localized task activity and its distributed task {FC}. Here we systematically evaluated the differential contributions of task-related activity and {FC} changes to identify a relationship between localized and distributed processes across the cortical hierarchy. We found that across multiple tasks, the magnitude of regional task-evoked activity was high in unimodal areas, but low in transmodal areas. In contrast, we found that task-state {FC} was significantly reduced in unimodal areas relative to transmodal areas. This revealed a strong negative relationship between localized task activity and distributed {FC} across cortical regions that was associated with the previously reported principal gradient of macroscale organization. Moreover, this dissociation corresponded to hierarchical cortical differences in the intrinsic timescale estimated from resting-state {fMRI} and region myelin content estimated from structural {MRI}. Together, our results contribute to a growing literature illustrating the differential contributions of a hierarchical cortical gradient representing localized and distributed cognitive processes.},

We present a novel procedure that identifies brain regions responsive to sensory information accumulated over different time scales. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging activity while observers viewed silent films presented forward, backward, or piecewise-scrambled in time. Early visual areas (e.g., primary visual cortex and the motion-sensitive area {MT}+) exhibited high response reliability regardless of disruptions in temporal structure. In contrast, the reliability of responses in several higher brain areas, including the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), precuneus, posterior lateral sulcus ({LS}), temporal parietal junction ({TPJ}), and frontal eye field ({FEF}), was affected by information accumulated over longer time scales. These regions showed highly reproducible responses for repeated forward, but not for backward or piecewise-scrambled presentations. Moreover, these regions exhibited marked differences in temporal characteristics, with {LS}, {TPJ}, and {FEF} responses depending on information accumulated over longer durations (∼36 s) than {STS} and precuneus (∼12 s). We conclude that, similar to the known cortical hierarchy of spatial receptive fields, there is a hierarchy of progressively longer temporal receptive windows in the human brain.},

This suggests a role of {INT} in encoding inputs through matching the inputs’ stochastics with the ongoing temporal statistics of the brain’s neural activity, i.e., input encoding. Following simulation and empirical data, we point out input integration versus segregation and input sampling as key temporal mechanisms of input processing. This deeply grounds the brain within its environmental and evolutionary context. It carries major implications in understanding mental features and psychiatric disorders, as well as going beyond the brain in integrating timescales into artificial intelligence.},

We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from {fMRI} and electrophysiology. Crucially, we extended existing electrophysiological hierarchies to whole-brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Further, with these results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional functional connectivity ({FC}) topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match {FC} gradient topographies across the whole brain.

	abstract = {Intrinsic timescales of brain regions exhibit heterogeneity, escalating with hierarchical levels, and are crucial for the temporal integration of external stimuli. Aging, often associated with cognitive decline, involves progressive neuronal and synaptic loss, reshaping brain structure and dynamics. However, the impact of these structural changes on temporal coding in the aging brain remains unclear. We mapped intrinsic timescales and gray matter volume ({GMV}) using magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) in young and elderly adults. We found shorter intrinsic timescales across multiple large-scale functional networks in the elderly cohort, and a significant positive association between intrinsic timescales and {GMV}. Additionally, age-related decline in performance on visual discrimination tasks was linked to a reduction in intrinsic timescales in the cuneus. To explain these age-related shifts, we developed an age-dependent spiking neuron network model. In younger subjects, brain regions were near a critical branching regime, while regions in elderly subjects had fewer neurons and synapses, pushing the dynamics toward a subcritical regime. The model accurately reproduced the empirical results, showing longer intrinsic timescales in young adults due to critical slowing down. Our findings reveal how age-related structural brain changes may drive alterations in brain dynamics, offering testable predictions and informing possible interventions targeting cognitive decline.},

By analysing resting-state {fMRI} data, we identified shorter neural timescales in the sensory/visual cortices and a longer timescale in the right caudate in autism. The shorter intrinsic timescales in the sensory/visual areas were correlated with the severity of autism, whereas the longer timescale in the caudate was associated with cognitive rigidity. These observations were confirmed from neurodevelopmental perspectives and replicated in two independent cross-sectional datasets. Moreover, the intrinsic timescale was correlated with local grey matter volume. This study shows that functional and structural atypicality in local brain areas is linked to higher-order cognitive symptoms in autism.},

However, recent electrophysiological and hemodynamic evidence suggest state-dependent propagation of infra-slow fluctuations, implying a functional role for ongoing infra-slow activity. Crucially, the study of infra-slow temporal lag structure has thus far been limited to large groups, as analyzing propagation delays requires extensive data averaging to overcome sampling variability. Here, we use resting-state {fMRI} data from 11 extensively-sampled individuals to characterize lag structure at the individual level. In addition to stable individual-specific features, we find spatiotemporal topographies in each subject similar to the group average. Notably, we find a set of early regions that are common to all individuals, are preferentially positioned proximal to multiple functional networks, and overlap with brain regions known to respond to diverse behavioral tasks—altogether consistent with a hypothesized ability to broadly influence cortical excitability. Our findings suggest that, like correlation structure, temporal lag structure is a fundamental organizational property of resting-state infra-slow activity.},

While theoretical accounts predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex and are relevant for cognition in both short and long terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.},

The question arises how such stable hierarchies give rise to adaptive behavior that requires flexible adjustment of temporal coding and integration demands. Potentially, this lack of variability in the hierarchical organization of neural timescales could reflect the structure of the laboratory contexts. We posit that unconstrained paradigms are ideal to test whether the dynamics of neural timescales reflect behavioral demands. Here we measured timescales of local field potential activity while male rhesus macaques foraged in an open space. We found a hierarchy of neural timescales that differs from previous work. Importantly, although the magnitude of neural timescales expanded with task engagement, the brain areas’ relative position in the hierarchy was stable. Next, we demonstrated that the change in neural timescales is dynamic and contains functionally-relevant information, differentiating between similar events in terms of motor demands and associated reward. Finally, we demonstrated that brain areas are differentially affected by these behavioral demands. These results demonstrate that while the space of neural timescales is anatomically constrained, the observed hierarchical organization and magnitude is dependent on behavioral demands.},

Using Signal Detection Theory ({SDT}), we operationalize the cognitive bias by the Criterion C as distinguished from the sensitivity index d'. This was probed in a self-task based on morphed self- and other faces. Behavioral data demonstrate clear cognitive bias, i.e., Criterion C. That was related to the {EEG}-based {INT} as measured by the autocorrelation window ({ACW}) in especially the transmodal regions dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({dlPFC}) and default-mode network ({DMN}) as distinct from unimodal visual cortex. Finally, simulation of the same paradigm in a large-scale network model shows high degrees of temporal integration of temporally distinct inputs in {CMS}/{DMN} and {dlPFC} while temporal segregation predominates in visual cortex. Together, we demonstrate a key role of {INT}-based temporal integration in {CMS}/{DMN} and {dlPFC} including its relation to the brain's uni-transmodal topographical organization in mediating the cognitive bias of our self.},

We demonstrate longer {ACW}-50 and {ACW}-0 in networks located at the core compared to those at the periphery with rest and task states showing a high {ACW} correlation. Calculating rest-task differences, i.e., subtracting the shared core-periphery organization, reveals task-specific {ACW} changes in distinct networks. Finally, employing kernel density estimation, machine learning, and simulation, we demonstrate that {ACW}-0 exhibits better prediction in classifying a region’s time window as core or periphery.

We obtained four primary findings: (i) the distinct behavioral states can be accurately predicted from {INT}, (ii) {INT} become longer during behavioral states compared to rest, (iii) {INT} change from rest to task is correlated negatively with the variability of {INT} during rest, (iv) neural mass modeling shows a key role of recurrent connections in mediating the rest-task change of {INT}. Extending current findings, our results show the dynamic nature of the brain's {INT} in reflecting continuous behavior through their flexible rest-task modulation possibly mediated by recurrent connections.},

While this method is based upon the theoretical works of Del Moral et al. (2006), the application to approximate Bayesian computation results in a bias in the approximation to the posterior. An alternative version based on genuine importance sampling arguments bypasses this difficulty, in connection with the population Monte Carlo method of Cappé et al. (2004), and it includes an automatic scaling of the forward kernel. When applied to a population genetics example, it compares favourably with two other versions of the approximate algorithm.},

A major challenge is to understand how a vast diversity of functions is subserved by parcellated areas of mammalian neocortex composed of repetitions of a canonical local circuit. Areas of the cerebral cortex differ from each other not only in their input–output patterns but also in their biological properties. Recent experimental and theoretical work has revealed that such variations are not random heterogeneities; rather, synaptic excitation and inhibition display systematic macroscopic gradients across the entire cortex, and they are abnormal in mental illness. Quantitative differences along these gradients can lead to qualitatively novel behaviours in non-linear neural dynamical systems, by virtue of a phenomenon mathematically described as bifurcation. The combination of macroscopic gradients and bifurcations, in tandem with biological evolution, development and plasticity, provides a generative mechanism for functional diversity among cortical areas, as a general principle of large-scale cortical organization.},

Variation of intrinsic timescales across the neocortex reflects functional specialization of cortical areas, but less is known about how intrinsic timescales change during cognitive tasks. We measured intrinsic timescales of local spiking activity within columns of area V4 in male monkeys performing spatial attention tasks. The ongoing spiking activity unfolded across at least two distinct timescales, fast and slow. The slow timescale increased when monkeys attended to the receptive fields location and correlated with reaction times. By evaluating predictions of several network models, we found that spatiotemporal correlations in V4 activity were best explained by the model in which multiple timescales arise from recurrent interactions shaped by spatially arranged connectivity, and attentional modulation of timescales results from an increase in the efficacy of recurrent interactions. Our results suggest that multiple timescales may arise from the spatial connectivity in the visual cortex and flexibly change with the cognitive state due to dynamic effective interactions between neurons.},

An open question is how these intrinsic timescales are related to sensory or motor information processing and whether these dynamics have common patterns in different behavioral states. We address these questions by investigating the brain's intrinsic timescales in healthy controls, motor (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, locked-in syndrome), sensory (anesthesia, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome), and progressive reduction of sensory processing (from awake states over N1, N2, N3). We employed a combination of measures from {EEG} resting-state data: auto-correlation window ({ACW}), power spectral density ({PSD}), and power-law exponent ({PLE}). Prolonged neural timescales accompanied by a shift towards slower frequencies were observed in the conditions with sensory deficits, but not in conditions with motor deficits. Our results establish that the spontaneous activity's intrinsic neural timescale is related to the neural capacity that specifically supports sensory rather than motor information processing in the healthy brain.},

Theoretically, intrinsic timescales are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli at multiple stages. However, direct links between timescales at rest and sensory processing, as well as translation to the auditory system are lacking. Here, we measured intracranial {EEG} in 11 human patients with epilepsy (4 women), while listening to pure tones. We show that, in the auditory network, intrinsic neural timescales progressively increase, while the spectral exponent flattens, from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Within the neocortex, intrinsic timescales exhibit spatial gradients that follow the temporal lobe anatomy. Crucially, intrinsic timescales at baseline can explain the latency of auditory responses: as intrinsic timescales increase, so do the single-electrode response onset and peak latencies. Our results suggest that the human auditory network exhibits a repertoire of intrinsic neural dynamics, which manifest in cortical gradients with millimeter resolution and may provide a variety of temporal windows to support auditory processing.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Endogenous neural dynamics are often characterized by their intrinsic timescales. These are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli. However, a direct link between intrinsic timing at rest and sensory processing is missing. Here, with intracranial {EEG}, we show that intrinsic timescales progressively increase from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Intrinsic timescales at baseline can explain the variability in the timing of intracranial {EEG} responses to sounds: cortical electrodes with fast timescales also show fast- and short-lasting responses to auditory stimuli, which progressively increase in the hippocampus and amygdala. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of neural dynamics in the temporal lobe manifests across cortical and limbic structures and can explain the temporal richness of auditory responses.},
