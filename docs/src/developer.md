# Developer documentation

!!! note "Contributing guidelines"
    If you haven't, please read the [Contributing guidelines](contributing.md) first.

If you want to make contributions to this package that involves code, then this guide is for you.

## First time clone

!!! tip "If you have writing rights"
    If you have writing rights, you don't have to fork. Instead, simply clone and skip ahead. Whenever **upstream** is mentioned, use **origin** instead.

If this is the first time you work with this repository, follow the instructions below to clone the repository.

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your repo (this will create a `git remote` called `origin`)
3. Add this repo as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/your_username/IntrinsicTimescales.jl
   ```

This will ensure that you have two remotes in your git: `origin` and `upstream`.
You will create branches and push to `origin`, and you will fetch and update your local `main` branch from `upstream`.

## Testing

As with most Julia packages, you can just open Julia in the repository folder, activate the environment, and run `test`:

```julia-repl
julia> # press ]
pkg> activate .
pkg> test
```

### Branch naming

- If there is an associated issue, add the issue number.
- If there is no associated issue, **and the changes are small**, add a prefix such as "typo", "hotfix", "small-refactor", according to the type of update.
- If the changes are not small and there is no associated issue, then create the issue first, so we can properly discuss the changes.
- Use dash separated imperative wording related to the issue (e.g., `14-add-tests`, `15-fix-model`, `16-remove-obsolete-files`).

### Commit message

- Use imperative or present tense, for instance: *Add feature* or *Fix bug*.
- Have informative titles.
- When necessary, add a body with details.
- If there are breaking changes, add the information to the commit message.

### Before creating a pull request

!!! tip "Atomic git commits"
    Try to create "atomic git commits" (recommended reading: [The Utopic Git History](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-utopic-git-history-d44b81c09593)).

- Make sure the tests pass.
- Fetch any `main` updates from upstream and rebase your branch, if necessary:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main BRANCH_NAME
  ```

- Then you can open a pull request and work with the reviewer to address any issues.

## Building and viewing the documentation locally

Following the latest suggestions, we recommend using `LiveServer` to build the documentation.
Here is how you do it:

1. Run `julia --project=docs` to open Julia in the environment of the docs.
1. If this is the first time building the docs
   1. Press `]` to enter `pkg` mode
   1. Run `pkg> dev .` to use the development version of your package
   1. Press backspace to leave `pkg` mode
1. Run `julia> using LiveServer`
1. Run `julia> servedocs()`
