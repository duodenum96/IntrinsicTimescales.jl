# [Contributing Guidelines](@id contributing)

First of all, thanks for the interest!

We welcome all kinds of contribution, including, but not limited to code, documentation, examples, configuration, issue creating, etc. Every minute of an open source developer's time is considered the most valuable gift: their time and appreciated. 

Needless to say, be polite and respectful when interacting with strangers while you are contributing. Currently, IntrinsicTimescales.jl is maintained by only one person, it would be great to have other developers / contributers. Therefore please be patient if I can't address your problems in a timely manner.
